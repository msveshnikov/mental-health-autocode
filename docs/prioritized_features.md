improvements for the Mental Health & Wellness Platform:

1. Mobile App Development: Create a robust mobile application to complement the web platform,

   recommendations, content, and interventions based on user behavior, preferences, and progress.
   This can significantly enhance user engagement and the effectiveness of the platform.

   quality assurance of therapists. Include features for user reviews, scheduling, and secure video
   conferencing to create a seamless experience for both users and mental health professionals.

   mechanisms to continuously gather data on user engagement, feature usage, and outcomes. Use this
   information to drive data-informed decisions for platform improvements and new feature
   development.

   partnerships with employers for corporate wellness programs. This could include group sessions,
   employee progress tracking (with privacy considerations), and customized content for workplace
   mental health.

These priorities focus on expanding the platform's reach, improving user experience, ensuring
quality of care, driving data-informed improvements, and tapping into the B2B market for sustainable
growth.
